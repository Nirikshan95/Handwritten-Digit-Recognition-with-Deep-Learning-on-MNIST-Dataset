# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-with-Deep-Learning-on-MNIST-Dataset
Developed a deep learning model to accurately  classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Overview
This project involves the implementation of a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize and classify handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The model was trained to achieve high accuracy in classifying digits from 0 to 9.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data normalization and reshaping for better performance.
- **Training**: Model trained using the Adam optimizer with categorical cross-entropy loss.
- **Evaluation**: The model was evaluated on the test set with high accuracy.

## Key Features
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved over 98% accuracy on the test dataset.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: The model can be used for real-time handwritten digit recognition.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset, which includes 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, was used for training and evaluating the model. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image representing a digit from 0 to 9.
